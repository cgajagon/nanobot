# ADR-005: Observability Standard

## Status

Accepted — Phase 2 superseded: Langfuse v4 provides OTEL-based tracing
(see `nanobot/observability/langfuse.py`).

## Date

2026-03-11

## Context

Current observability in Nanobot:

- **Logging**: loguru with unstructured string formatting across all modules.
- **Metrics**: Legacy `MetricsCollector` removed — observability now via Langfuse.
- **Tracing**: None. No correlation IDs, no spans, no distributed tracing.

For a professional agent framework, we need to answer questions like:

- "Which tool call caused this session to exceed the token budget?"
- "What was the latency breakdown for this delegation chain?"
- "How often does memory retrieval fall back from mem0 to local?"

## Decision

### Phase 1 — Structured Logging + Correlation IDs (immediate)

1. **Add correlation IDs** threaded through all operations:
   - `request_id` — unique per inbound message
   - `session_id` — conversation session key
   - `agent_id` — role name for multi-agent delegation

2. **Add structured fields** to key log sites:
   - LLM calls: `model`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `latency_ms`
   - Tool execution: `tool_name`, `duration_ms`, `success`, `error_type`
   - Memory retrieval: `query`, `results_count`, `source` (mem0/local/reranked)
   - Delegation: `from_role`, `to_role`, `depth`, `latency_ms`

3. **Keep loguru** as the logging backend. Use loguru's `bind()` for structured context
   and `serialize=True` sink option for JSON output when needed.

### Phase 2 — OpenTelemetry (implemented via Langfuse v4)

~~When the need arises for distributed tracing or integration with external observability
platforms (Grafana, Datadog, etc.), introduce OpenTelemetry spans. This is explicitly
deferred to avoid premature complexity.~~

**Implemented (2026-03-14)**: Langfuse v4 SDK creates an OTEL `TracerProvider` that
auto-captures litellm LLM calls as GENERATION observations. Custom spans wrap
request processing, tool execution, context assembly, verification, and delegation.
See `nanobot/observability/langfuse.py` for the full integration.

### Phase 3 — InstrumentedProvider (2026-03-31)

The litellm OTEL callback for LLM call capture has been replaced by an explicit
`InstrumentedProvider` wrapper (`nanobot/observability/instrumented_provider.py`).
This wrapper implements the `LLMProvider` protocol and delegates to the underlying
provider while emitting a Langfuse GENERATION observation for every `chat()` and
`stream()` call, including token counts, model name, and latency.

**Rationale**: The litellm OTEL callback was registered as a global side-effect at
startup and produced `_EndedSpanFilter` noise in logs. The explicit wrapper approach
is cleaner, testable, and does not depend on litellm internals. It is wired at the
composition root (`agent_factory.py`) so all LLM calls — regardless of provider
implementation — are captured.

### MetricsCollector — Removed

The legacy `MetricsCollector` (in-memory counters flushed to `metrics.json`) has been
removed.  All observability counters are now captured via **Langfuse** (OTEL callback
for litellm, plus explicit span metadata for token consumption).  The `metrics.json`
file is no longer written.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Correlation IDs make it possible to trace a request through the full processing chain.
- Structured fields enable log analysis and alerting without a heavy tracing framework.
- No new dependencies required for Phase 1 (loguru already supports structured binding).

### Negative

- Threading correlation IDs requires passing context through function signatures or using
  contextvars (adds complexity to function signatures).
- JSON-serialized logs are less human-readable in development (mitigate with a dev-only
  pretty-print sink).

### Neutral

- MetricsCollector removed; Langfuse is the single observability backend.
- OpenTelemetry decision deferred, not rejected.

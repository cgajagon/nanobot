"""Web channel — bridges the FastAPI HTTP layer with the agent bus.

The web channel acts like any other channel (Telegram, Discord, etc.) but
instead of connecting to an external platform it serves the assistant-ui
React frontend.  Each HTTP request registers a per-thread
``asyncio.Queue`` and publishes an ``InboundMessage`` to the bus.  When
the agent publishes ``OutboundMessage`` responses (including streaming
progress updates) the dispatcher routes them to the matching queue so
the HTTP handler can yield them as SSE events.
